# Forbes-MATLAB-Analysis
This program analyzes two separate excel files that contain the Forbes top 100 companies and creates three separate data visualizations based on user input 

Requires MATLAB to run
To run this program, call the function 'Forbesanalysis('filename','filename2')' 
where 'filename' has to be 'Forbes2014.xls' and 'filename2' has to be 'Forbes2004.xls'
Make sure you close the figure after each time you run the program.

The original data sets were modified to remove unnecessary data and to shorten it as a whole
